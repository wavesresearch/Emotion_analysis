This work is carried out at Department of ngineering Cybernetics NTNU, Trondheim, Norway.  
In this work, we aimed to develop an automated method to accurately detect the human
emotions using EEG signals. The available meethods in the literature to detect human
emotions are having complex network architectures. Hence, we evaluate the SEED and DEAP dataset with 
less complex classification models such as MLP and CNN. In this way, we can evaluate the effect of the spatial information on the accuracy of the emotion classification models.
The CNN model can use spatial information provided by the location of
the different EEG channels on the scalp. The MLP architecture is considered since its input is one
dimensional and does not take into account the spatial information.
